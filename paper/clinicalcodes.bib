abstract ={Aim: To assess the performance of the QRISK score for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) in an independent UK sample from general practice and compare with the Framingham score.Design: Prospective open cohort studySetting: UK general practices contributing to the THIN and QRESEARCH databases.Cohort: The THIN validation cohort consisted of 1.07 million patients, aged 35–74 years registered at 288 THIN practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2006. The QRESEARCH validation cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices (one-third of the full database) with data until 1 January 2007. Patients receiving statins, those with diabetes or CVD at baseline were excluded.End point: First diagnosis of CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and transient ischaemic attack) recorded on the clinical computer system during the study period.Exposures: Age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, body mass index, family history of premature CHD, deprivation and antihypertensive medication.Results: Characteristics of both cohorts were similar, except that THIN patients were from slightly more affluent areas and had lower recording of family history of CHD. QRISK performed better than Framingham for every discrimination and calibration statistic in both cohorts. Framingham overpredicted risk by 23% in the THIN cohort, while QRISK underpredicted risk by 12%.Conclusion: This analysis demonstrated that QRISK is better calibrated to the UK population than Framingham and has better discrimination. The results suggest that QRISK is likely to provide more appropriate risk estimates than Framingham to help identify patients at high risk of CVD in the UK.},

   abstract = {Reproducibility is a crucial property of data since it allows users to understand and verify how data were derived, and therefore allows them to put their trust in such data. Reproducibility is essential for science, because the reproducibility of experimental results is a tenet of the scientific method, but reproducibility is also beneficial in many other fields, including automated decision making, visualization, and automated data feeds. To achieve the vision of reproducibility, the workflow-based community has strongly advocated the use of provenance as an underpinning mechanism for reproducibility, since a rich representation of provenance allows steps to be reproduced and all intermediary and final results checked and validated. Concurrently, multiple ontology-based representations of provenance have been devised, to be able to describe past computations, uniformly across a variety of technologies. However, such Semantic Web representations of provenance do not have any formal link with execution. Even assuming a faithful and non-malicious environment, how can we claim that an ontology-based representation of provenance enables reproducibility, since it has not been given any execution semantics, and therefore has no formal way of expressing the reproduction of computations? This is the problem that this paper tackles by defining a denotational semantics for the Open Provenance Model, which is referred to as the reproducibility semantics. This semantics is used to implement a reproducibility service, leveraging multiple Semantic Web technologies, and offering a variety of reproducibility approaches, found in the literature. A series of empirical experiments were designed to exhibit the range of reproducibility capabilities of our approach; in particular, we demonstrate the ability to reproduce computations involving multiple technologies, as is commonly found on the Web.},

abstract = {Electronic health records are increasingly used for research. The definition of cases or endpoints often relies on the use of coded diagnostic data, using a pre-selected group of codes. Validation of these cases, as ‘true’ cases of the disease, is crucial. There are, however, ambiguities in what is meant by validation in the context of electronic records. Validation usually implies comparison of a definition against a gold standard of diagnosis and the ability to identify false negatives (‘true’ cases which were not detected) as well as false positives (detected cases which did not have the condition). We argue that two separate concepts of validation are often conflated in existing studies. Firstly, whether the GP thought the patient was suffering from a particular condition (which we term confirmation or internal validation) and secondly, whether the patient really had the condition (external validation). Few studies have the ability to detect false negatives who have not received a diagnostic code. Natural language processing is likely to open up the use of free text within the electronic record which will facilitate both the validation of the coded diagnosis and searching for false negatives.

abstract ={OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause mortality rates and the incidence of major vascular events among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) without RA, or no arthritis using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) while adjusting for age and sex. Clinic-based studies have found that patients with RA have higher all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality than those without RA, after adjusting for age and sex. Much smaller elevations in risk have been found in the few community-based studies that have addressed this question. METHODS: After excluding patients with a history of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular events, we followed a retrospective cohort of patients 40 years and older from GPRD practices until the earliest of death, disenrollment, or the occurrence of an incident vascular event. Using Poisson regression we compared age and gender adjusted incidence rates for RA, OA, or no arthritis. RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety-four practices contributed 2.37 million patients (1.11 million men and 1.26 million women) to the analysis. Over a mean duration of followup of almost 5 years, age and gender adjusted all-cause mortality rates were 60 to 70% higher in patients with RA compared to patients with OA and those with no arthritis. For the various vascular endpoints, the age and gender adjusted incidence rates were 30 to 60% higher in patients with RA compared to both patients with OA and those with no arthritis during the study period. The rates in patients with OA and those with no arthritis were essentially the same. CONCLUSION: Compared to patients with OA and those with no arthritis, patients with RA had a higher age and gender adjusted incidence of all-cause mortality and of major vascular events during almost 5 years of followup.},
