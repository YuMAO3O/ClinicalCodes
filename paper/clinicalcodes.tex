\section*{Abstract}

Lists of clinical codes are the foundation for research undertaken using electronic medical records and without access to them, reviewers are unable to determine the validity of research, true replication is impossible and researchers are unable to make effective comparisons between studies and are subject to much duplication of effort in building new code lists.  Despite this, publication of clinical codes is rarely if ever a requirement for obtaining grants, validating protocols or publishing research.  We have built a centralised online repository where electronic medical records researchers can upload and download lists of clinical codes to help address these problems.  The repository will enable clinical researchers to better validate electronic medical records studies, build on previous code lists and compare disease definitions across studies.  It will also assist health informaticians in replicating database studies, tracking changes in disease definitions or clinical coding practice through time and sharing clinical code information across platforms and data sources as research objects. 

\section*{Introduction}

Over the last 20 years, increasing numbers of general practitioners have used computers to store patients medical records for various administrative functions \cite{Purves1996}. Hospitals are also beginning to store their records electronically, though electronic records are far less prevalent than in primary care \cite{Ashish2009}. These electronic medical records (EMRs) offer great potential for research, enabling the rapid identification of patients for inclusion in intervention and observational studies. As their use becomes more widespread, it is becoming more important to have better means for ensuring and evaluating the validity of these studies. EMRs are being used by researchers to address important questions in healthcare that would be difficult or impossible to address using randomised controlled trials, because of the costs involved, the low prevalence of conditions or because a condition may occur in a subgroup such as children or pregnant women. In UK primary care in particular, the annual number of research outputs based on the three main UK primary care databases (The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, formerly the General Practice Research Database, GPRD), The Health Improvement Network (THIN) and QResearch) appears to be increasing at an exponential rate (figure \ref{figure1_articles_per_year}). 


Much research has been done into establishing the internal and external validity of EMR studies \cite{Herrett2010}, particularly from the point of view of data quality, data completeness and confounding.  There has also been work replicating studies from one EMR database in another to assess their external validity; i.e. the generalisability of their findings to other populations \cite{Hippisley-Cox2008, Vinogradova2013, Reeves2014}.  Where possible, PCD studies are also used to replicate randomised controlled trials and re-assess the effectiveness of interventions, in particular to patient groups that had been excluded in the original trails \cite{Tannen2008, Tannen2009}. Even if all of these issues are adequately addressed, most EMR studies still assume that the underlying definitions of clinical entities (such as conditions, treatments and monitoring tests) are valid.  However, these clinical entities are defined through lists of `clinical codes' and the process of preparing these code lists is rarely straightforward and can often lack rigor \cite{Dave2009}.  Despite the importance of clinical code list validity, and calls for sharing of code lists and greater transparency in the selection of code lists and reporting of sensitivity analyses using different sets of codes\cite{Gulliford2009, Bhattarai2012}, code lists are still seldom reported in published papers \cite{Herrett2010}.  There is also currently no obligation on researchers to publish their code lists by funding bodies, journals or regulators.  Furthermore, there is no centralised repository to hold lists of clinical codes. In most cases it is impossible to determine whether the validity of code lists used in EMR research. 

There is also a gradual movement towards more transparency and openness in academic research (particularly in disciplines where there is high computational load) at the levels of academic research \cite{Bechhofer2013, Stodden2013, Pampel2013} and learned societies \cite{RoyalSoc2012} as well as growing pressure from governmental organisations to share publicly funded research data \cite{EuropeanCommission2012, OfficeSciTech2013}.

To address the issue outlined above and to facilitate transparency, sharing and retrieval of code-lists, we developed www.ClinicalCodes.org, a web repository for EMR researchers to freely upload and download clinical code lists.  Below we give an overview of the role and use of clinical codes in EMR research and provide details on the features of the ClinicalCodes repository.


\section*{The role of clinical codes in EMR databases and research}


Clinical entities in EMR databases are entered by medical professionals as clinical codes.  In UK, European and North American primary care, Read codes are the most commonly used clinical code, while the ICD-9/10 system is more common in hospital records.  These codes form a hierarchical classification system for reporting and research purposes and can be used to define symptoms, signs and diagnoses, referrals to hospitals and clinics, immunisation records, prescribed medications and diagnostic test results.

The process of drawing up code lists to identify clinical entities of interest (e.g patients with a given clinical condition, patients on particular medications, patients with certain diagnostic test, smoking status etc.) is a critical step in setting up EMR studies and multiple code lists will often be required within one study to define multiple conditions, covariates, confounders and outcomes.  This is often a complicated and time-consuming process involving defining the clinical entity of interest and iteratively searching for codes in lookup tables, running searches for codes in different sections of the database, collating the results and classifying them (generally by clinically trained investigators) \cite{Dave2009, Nicholson2013}.  The built in flexibility and redundancy of clinical coding systems allows practitioners to use a variety of codes to describe a given condition and minimises their time spent searching for codes, but it presents a challenge to researchers using these codes to effectively define a clinical entity.A patient may receive one of several possible diagnostic codes as well as, or instead of, one or more codes describing symptoms or investigations. This flexibility in the coding structure facilitates the clinical use of these codes, minimising the time spent searching for codes by practitioners. However, this multitude of codes for a given condition presents a challenge when data need to be aggregated. For example, a diagnosis of a disease condition could rely on a combination of codes representing diagnoses, symptoms, prescribed drugs and diagnostic tests in order to accurately identify patients with that condition.  On the other hand, some entities can be identified with a very simple code list, or even a single clinical code \cite{Kotz2011}.


The selection of codes used to identify conditions, comorbidities etc.  will vary according to the particular question being asked, partly reflecting the degree of certainty of diagnosis required. Sometimes it is important to identify all possible cases but at other times the study population may need to be restricted to cases where diagnosis is more certain. This variability in code-lists may have major implications for results of all studies using EMRs \cite{Nicholson2011}. For example, a sevenfold variation in estimates of incidence of rheumatoid arthritis can be largely explained by differences in code-lists \cite{Garcia2009, Watson2003}.  To account for such variation some studies have used different subsets of code-lists in sensitivity analyses \cite{Doran2011, Herrett2010}.  Furthermore, and in particular for uncommon diseases, small errors in code selection can result in large numbers of misclassified patients, leading to biased results and classification errors affecting conclusions in unpredictable ways \cite{Manuel2010}. Clinical definitions may also change over time, resulting in a need to revise the corresponding code list \cite{Gulliford2009}, a good example being a change in the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) Business rules in 2006. When QOF was first introduced, people with diabetes were identified on the basis of any diabetes code, including non-specific diabetic type codes.  From April 2006, the case definition for diabetes was restricted to only include codes that specified type I or type II diabetes \cite{Calvert2009}.  In practice this meant that about 170 previously used Read codes were no longer being used to identify the condition. Finally, different researchers may have different interpretations of the relevance of particular codes.

\section*{Reporting of codes in the current literature}

A large component of total EMR research is made up by primary care database (PCD) studies and UK PCDs are among the most researched in the world.  Figure \ref{figure1_articles_per_year} shows that research interest using UK PCDs is increasing at an exponential rate, while figure \ref{figure2_PCD_map} shows that research using UK PCDs is being conducted in universities, pharmaceutical companies and research hospitals around the world, rather than being limited to the UK.  As one of the largest and most important resources for EMR-based research, it seems reasonable to expect reporting of code-lists in UK PCD-based studies to be at least as comprehensive as in other EMR studies.  To evaluate levels of transparency in the reporting of clinical code lists, we took a representative sample of UK PCD studies and assessed each study on its extent of reporting of the clinical codes used.

We took a sample of 450 papers from the original 1359 output from a PubMed search.  Of these, 392 (87\%) had both  the full text accessible to the University of Manchester library and were examples of primary PCD research.  Of these 392, less than 9\% published the entire set of clinical codes needed to reproduce the study in an online appendix and only 12\% stated that the clinical codes are available upon request \ref{tab:table1_percentages}.


\section*{The need for transparency in clinical code usage}


We identify four main consequences of lack of transparency of clinical code lists.  First, if code lists are not available and not expected to be published alongside the primary research using them, they represent an important part of a study methodology that is not subject to scrutiny or peer review. In the extreme case, there is no way to determine if a condition diagnosis in a study is valid and clinical decisions could be based on the invalid assumptions drawn from an invalid diagnosis.  This could happen despite rigorous downstream statistical analysis.  Second, the effective replication of EMR studies is dependent on the availability of the clinical codes in the original study.  If all of the codes are not available, it is impossible to tell if differences found in study replications are due to artefactual differences in code lists or if they are genuine.  Third, if code-lists are unknown, comparisons between studies on the same condition are potentially invalidated.  Condition definitions change over time and GP coding practice may also change with respect to regulations and incentives \cite{Calvert2009}. Also, different studies may use different types of codes for a condition; some studies, for example, include medication and monitoring codes as part of their definition of a patient with diabetes (e.g. \cite{Mulnier2006}) while others do not (e.g. \cite{Kontopantelis2014}).  Not having access to code-lists means that it is difficult to know whether fair comparisons are being made between studies. Fourth, building code lists is a time consuming process; having access to historical code-lists  for a condition would mean that new lists could be built incrementally and iteratively, saving much 'reinvention of the wheel' while increasing consistency, and potentially accuracy, of definitions across studies.



\section*{The ClinicalCodes online repository}

The main ClinicalCodes database consists of Articles containing metadata such as citation details and abstracts.  Code-lists are associated with these and individual clinical codes with the code-lists. All individual clinical codes are assigned a code name, coding system (e.g. Read, OXMIS, SNOMED), description and entity type (e.g. diagnostic, drug code, test).  Users are able to upload additional data for codes as either supplementary fields for individual codes or as comments at the code list or article level.  Code lists can be downloaded by any users but an account must be created to upload article metadata or code lists or to leave comments. Code lists can be downloaded in aggregate as a zip file or individually as csv files. If a code lists from a previous article has been used verbatim in a new study, the ClinicalCodes entry for the new study can link to the previous code list.  This reduces workload in uploading lists that are unchanged from previous studies while retaining information on the origin of code lists.  At the time of publication, we have uploaded the complete code lists used for two papers from our group \cite{Doran2011, Kontopantelis2014} as well as codes from the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework Business rules versions 5 and 24 - a total of 13191 clinical codes across 97 code lists covering medical conditions, lifestyle variables such as smoking status, physical observations such as BMI and testing for example for retinal screening and blood sugar levels.

We have endeavored to make the upload and download processes as painless as possible. In particular, download of individual code lists is a one-click operation requiring no log in or provision of user information.  The comments feature, which is available for articles and code lists, enables both the study authors to add extra methodological information and for other researchers to raise questions and issues on the code lists which could further assist the development of future code lists.

\subsection*{Clinical Codes as research objects}

%%%% ro stuff not yet implemented in ClinicalCodes.. %%%%

Research objects are annotated aggregations of data often associated with a scientific publication that facilitate reuse and reproducibility of scientific research \cite{Bechhofer2010}. Following this model, metadata and links to code lists for articles are available as research objects that can be shared across platforms in machine readable form.  In practice, this means that a JSON manifest file is available for each article containing: Article metadata (title, author, abstract, reference, link, doi), article level comments, code list level comments and links to the individual code list files. These research object files are available directly by adding a `/ro' to the URI for an article (e.g. www.clinicalcodes.org/medcodes/article/5/ro).  The research object format is designed to be available without getting in the way of the main method of download that will be required by most users.  We have also developed open source functions in R to automate the download of code lists and metadata via the research object file (https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rClinicalCodes). An example JSON manifest file is shown in the online appendix.

\section*{Conclusions}

% Biosharing.org
% re3data.org
% force11.org

Large electronic medical datasets, including medical records datasets are already playing an important role in clinical research and this role is set to grow in the era of big data in healthcare \cite{Wang2013}. The continuing success of big data in healthcare will depend on the ability of researchers to access and validate that data and then combine it with other sources \cite{Murdoch2013}.  We have developed a repository for clinical codes that will be of great use to two groups of researchers.  First, clinical researchers using primary care and other medical databases will be able to more effectively validate their research, build upon previous code lists and match appropriate disease definitions through time. Second, health informaticians will more easily be able to produce study replications (e.g. replications across databases such as \cite{Reeves2014}), share clinical code data as research objects across platforms and data sources and use the ClinicalCodes database as a research resource in its own right (e.g. to track changes in disease definitions and clinical coding practice through time).

Researchers using the ClinicalCodes repository can benefit from faster and more consistent development of new code lists, improvements in research quality associated with better scrutiny of lists of clinical codes, greater exposure and potential for studies with uploaded codes to be more highly cited and also from discovering other researchers working in the same area.

Despite these motivations, the success of this project will depend on its adoption by the electronic medical records research community. Although ClinicalCodes solves the problem of having a centralised repository for holding codes, the problem remains that there are few if any requirements for researchers to make clinical code lists accessible. We believe that adoption and support of a centralised clinical codes repository by regulators, funding bodies and publishers of electronic medical records research will be of great benefit to the electronic medical records research community.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Article Classification}

To get an estimate of the extent of the problem of lack of transparency in clinical code-lists in EMR studies, we collected articles conducting primary research using the three major UK-wide Primary care databases (PCDs) (The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, formerly the General Practice Research Database; The Health Improvement Network; QResearch).  The UK has one of the most extensive and longest running systems of collection of EMRs and The main UK PCDs are the subject of considerable research interest.  A Search was made on Pubmed for articles with the following terms: ``CPRD'', ``Clinical Practice Research Datalink'', ``GPRD'', ``General Practice Research Database'', ``The Health improvement Network'', ``QResearch''. This gave 1359 articles  A random sample of 450 articles from this Pubmed search was taken for further analysis.  From this sample, all articles were identified that were both primary EMR research and had their full text accessable via the University of Manchester library (392 articles). We then scored each paper as belonging or not to the following categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Any clinical codes listed in the methods section
    \item At least one full code list provided in the paper or in an appendix
    \item All code lists provided to enable replication of the study
    \item States that ``Code lists are available on request'' 
\end{enumerate}

Analyses were performed using R v2.15.2 \cite{R2012}. Article counts over time and geo-coded article affiliations (Via the Google Geocoder API) were aggregated using the R package rpubmed (https://github.com\slash ropensci/rpubmed).

\subsection*{Database Architecture and Web Interface}

The back end data is stored in a relational database called PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org). Server-side web programming was done in Python v2.7.5 (http://www.python.org) using the Django v1.5 web framework (https://www.djangoproject.com). The client side scripting was done in JavaScript and HTML5 and used Twitter Bootstrap v3 (http://getbootstrap.com) as a front-end framework.  The dynamic parts of the site were served using Gunicorn v18.0 (http://gunicorn.org) and static parts with Nginx v1.0.15 (http://nginx.org). Cacheing and sessions are handled by a Redis v2.4.10 NoSQL database (http://redis.io). The repository is hosted on a 64 bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux server release 6.4 virtual machine at the University of Manchester.
