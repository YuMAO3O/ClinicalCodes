    "article_abstract" : "Objectives: To investigate the effect of withdrawing incentives on recorded quality of care, in the context of the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework pay-for-performance scheme. Design: Retrospective longitudinal study. Setting: Data for 644 general practices, from 2004/5 to 2011/12, extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants: All patients registered with any of the practices over the study period, 13,772,992 in total. Intervention: The removal of financial incentives for aspects of care for patients with asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke and psychosis. Main outcome measures: Performance on eight clinical quality indicators withdrawn from a national incentive scheme: influenza immunisation (asthma) and lithium therapy monitoring (psychosis), removed in April 2006; blood pressure monitoring (coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke), cholesterol level monitoring (coronary heart disease, diabetes) and blood glucose monitoring (diabetes), removed in April 2011. Multilevel mixed effects multiple linear regression models were used to quantify the effect of incentive withdrawal. Results: Mean levels of performance were generally stable after the removal of the incentives, both short- and long-term. For the two indicators removed in April 2006/7, levels in 2011/12 were very close to 2005/6 levels, although a small but statistically significant drop was estimated for influenza immunisation. For five of the six indicators withdrawn in from April 2011/12, there was no significant impact on performance in that year following removal and differences between predicted and observed scores were small. Performance on related outcome indicators retained in the scheme (e.g. blood pressure control) was generally unaffected. Conclusions: Following the removal of incentives, levels of performance across a range of clinical activities generally remained stable. This indicates that health benefits from incentive schemes can potentially be increased by periodically replacing existing indicators with new indicators relating to alternative aspects of care. However, most of the aspects of care we investigated remained indirectly incentivised and further work is required to assess the generalisability of the findings when incentives are fully withdrawn.",

The Quality and Outcomes Framework reporting rules for practices list acceptable codes for identifying patients with relevant conditions,1 but we included additional codes to avoid underestimating prevalence and to control for changes in coding behaviour following the introduction of the scheme.2 As practices might not have attached diagnostic codes to all relevant patients, we conducted sensitivity analyses by identifying additional patients using relevant management, referral, admission and prescription codes and terms. For example, for the main analysis patients with diabetes were identified using codes beginning C10 (diabetes mellitus), excluding non-diabetic specific codes (e.g. C10F811 – metabolic syndrome). Additional patients for sensitivity analyses were identified using codes relating to diabetic management (e.g. 66A – diabetic monitoring), referral (e.g. 8H4F.00 – referral to diabetologist), complications (e.g. 2BBF – retinal abnormality, diabetes related) or treatment (e.g. repeat prescriptions for insulin). The numbers of additional patients identified were generally small, and the results of the sensitivity analyses did not differ substantially from those of the main analysis. Patients for whom targets were met were identified using relevant Read codes and free-text terms."
