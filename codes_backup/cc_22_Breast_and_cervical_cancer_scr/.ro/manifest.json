{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/22","abstract":"Aims/hypothesis: Studies from healthcare databases suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) under-utilize cancer screening opportunities, but recording bias may be a problem. We evaluated the relative effect of T2D on screening utilization trends among long-established UK national programmes in breast and cervical cancers; and tested the impact of introducing a primary care financial incentive scheme (QOF) in 2004, known to improve data recording for diabetes-related care.\r\nMaterials and methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified women with prevalent T2DM (N = 174,256), separately by year for 1999 to 2011, and eligible for screening events for breast (aged 50-70 years) and cervical (aged 35-49 and 50-64 years) cancers. We described secular trends and compared these with the non-diabetes population, and accounted for co-morbidities using matched conditional logistic regression models. We performed interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses to assess the impact of the QOF introduction. \r\nResults: Compared with the non-diabetes population, relative uptake rates for breast and cervical screening were generally similar in patients with T2D pre-2004, becoming greater for years post-2004. These patterns were unaffected by adjustment for GP practice, and were not accounted for by T2D associated co-morbidities. ITS analysis showed increased activities in all three screening groups for 2007, but these broadly returned to pre-2004 trends by 2011, paralleling similar patterns in recording for other care provision indicators.\r\nConclusions/interpretation: In this population, we found no evidence that women with T2D under-utilize breast and cervical cancer screening opportunities. A financial incentive scheme was associated with intermediate-term improvements in screening utilization, but this is likely to reflect improved recording of care events.","article_ID":22,"article_title":"Breast and cervical cancer screening utilization, and recording bias, in women with type 2 diabetes (UK)","article_type":"Research article","authors":"Matthew Carr, Evan Kontopantelis, Tim Doran, Christine Campbell, Lorraine Lipscombe, Emma Crosbie, Anthony Howell, Iain E Buchan, Andrew G Renehan ","codelists":{"res22-diabetes":{"associated_articles":{"22":{"title":"Breast and cervical cancer screening utilization, and recording bias, in women with type 2 diabetes (UK)","year":2015}},"codelist_name":"res22: diabetes","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/22/codelist/res22-diabetes/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":494,"user_field_1":"","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"res22-diabetes_meds":{"associated_articles":{"22":{"title":"Breast and cervical cancer screening utilization, and recording bias, in women with type 2 diabetes (UK)","year":2015}},"codelist_name":"res22: diabetes_meds","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/22/codelist/res22-diabetes_meds/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":679,"user_field_1":"","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"res22-screen_breast":{"associated_articles":{"22":{"title":"Breast and cervical cancer screening utilization, and recording bias, in women with type 2 diabetes (UK)","year":2015}},"codelist_name":"res22: screen_breast","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/22/codelist/res22-screen_breast/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":50,"user_field_1":"","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"res22-screen_cervical":{"associated_articles":{"22":{"title":"Breast and cervical cancer screening utilization, and recording bias, in women with type 2 diabetes (UK)","year":2015}},"codelist_name":"res22: screen_cervical","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/22/codelist/res22-screen_cervical/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":91,"user_field_1":"","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""}},"comments":[],"correspondence_author":"Andrew Renehan","correspondence_email":"arenehan@picr.man.ac.uk","date_accessed":"2015-03-09 09:09:45 GMT","doi":"","fulltext":false,"journal":"Diabetologia","link":"","publication_year":2015,"uploading_user":"Matthew Carr"}
