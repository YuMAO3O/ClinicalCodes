{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/19","abstract":"Despite widespread use of clinical guidelines, actual care often falls short of ideal standards. Electronic health\r\nrecords (EHR) can be analyzed to provide information on how to improve care, but this is seldom done in sufficient\r\ndetail to guide specific action. We developed an algorithm to provide detailed, actionable information for care\r\nquality improvement, using blood pressure (BP) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an exemplar. We\r\nused UK clinical guidelines and EHR data from 440 patients in Salford (UK) to develop the algorithm. We then\r\napplied it to 532,409 individual patient records, identifying 11,097 CKD patients, 3,766 (34%) of which showed\r\nroom for improvement in their care: either through medication optimization or better BP monitoring. Manual\r\nrecord reviews indicated a positive-predictive value of 90%. This kind of algorithm could help improve the\r\nmanagement of long-term conditions by providing the missing link between clinical audit and decision support.","article_ID":19,"article_title":"Computing Care Quality Improvement Tactics from Health Records: Closing the Gap Between Audit and Action","article_type":"Research article","authors":"Benjamin Brown, Richard Williams, Matthew Sperrin, Timothy Frank, John Ainsworth, Iain Buchan","codelists":[],"comments":[],"correspondence_author":"Benjamin Brown","correspondence_email":"benjamin.brown@manchester.ac.uk","date_accessed":"2015-03-09 09:09:45 GMT","doi":"","fulltext":false,"journal":"AMIA Symposium","link":"","publication_year":2014,"uploading_user":"Richard Williams"}
