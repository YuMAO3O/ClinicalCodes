{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/20","abstract":"Objectives To measure trends in antibiotic prescribing in UK primary care in relation to nationally recommended best practice.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods A descriptive study linking individual patient data on diagnosis and prescription in a large primary care database, covering 537 UK general practices during 1995\u20132011.\r\n\r\nResults The proportion of cough/cold episodes for which antibiotics were prescribed decreased from 47% in 1995 to 36% in 1999, before increasing to 51% in 2011. There was marked variation by primary care practice in 2011 [10th\u201390th percentile range (TNPR) 32%\u201365%]. Antibiotic prescribing for sore throats fell from 77% in 1995 to 62% in 1999 and then stayed broadly stable (TNPR 45%\u201378%). Where antibiotics were prescribed for sore throat, recommended antibiotics were used in 69% of cases in 2011 (64% in 1995). The use of recommended short-course trimethoprim for urinary tract infection (UTI) in women aged 16\u201374 years increased from 8% in 1995 to 50% in 2011; however, a quarter of practices prescribed short courses in \u226416% of episodes in 2011. For otitis media, 85% of prescriptions were for recommended antibiotics in 2011, increasing from 77% in 1995. All these changes in annual prescribing were highly statistically significant (P\u200a<\u200a0.001).\r\n\r\nConclusions The implementation of national guidelines in UK primary care has had mixed success, with prescribing for coughs/colds, both in total and as a proportion of consultations, now being greater than before recommendations were made to reduce it. Extensive variation by practice suggests that there is significant scope to improve prescribing, particularly for coughs/colds and for UTIs.","article_ID":20,"article_title":"Trends in antibiotic prescribing in primary care for clinical syndromes subject to national recommendations to reduce antibiotic resistance, UK 1995-2011: analysis of a large database of primary care consultations","article_type":"Research article","authors":"Jeremy I.
