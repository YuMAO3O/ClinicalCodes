{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/9","abstract":"Background:\r\nObservational data have been used to inform target levels for modifiable risk factors in type 2 diabetes but these data are limited by confounding. We aimed to describe the shape of observed relationships between risk factor levels and clinically important outcomes in type 2 diabetes after adjusting for multiple confounders.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nWe used retrospective longitudinal data on 246,544 adults with type 2 diabetes from 600 practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 2006 and 2012. Proportional hazards regression models quantified the risks of mortality, microvascular or macrovascular events associated with four modifiable risk factors: glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure\r\nand total cholesterol, while controlling for numerous patient and practice covariates. \r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nU-shaped relationships were observed between all-cause mortality and levels of the four risk factors. The lowest risks were associated with HbA1c 7.25-7.75%; total cholesterol 3.5-4.5 mmol/L; systolic blood pressure 135-145 mmHg; and diastolic blood pressure 82.5-87.5 mmHg.  coronary and stroke mortality related to the four risk factors in a positive, curvilinear way, with the exception of blood pressure which related to coronary deaths in a U-shape. Macrovascular events showed a positive and curvilinear relationship with HbA1c but U-shaped for total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. Microvascular related to the four risk factors in a curvilinear way: positive for HbA1c and systolic blood pressure but negative for cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure.\r\n\r\nInterpretation:\r\nWe identified several relationships which, when considered in the light of relevant trial data, support a call for major changes to clinical practice. Most importantly, our results support trial data indicating that normalisation of glucose and blood pressure can lead to poorer outcomes, which makes a strong case for target ranges for these risk factors rather than target levels.","article_ID":9,"article_title":"Glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels and their relationships to clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study","article_type":"Research article","authors":"Evangelos Kontopantelis, David A Springate,  David Reeves,  Darren M Ashcroft,  Martin Rutter, Iain Buchan, Tim Doran","codelists":{"asthma_clinicals":{"associated_articles":{"5":{"title":"Withdrawing Performance Indicators: Retrospective Analysis of General Practice Performance Under the UKs Quality and Outcomes Framework","year":2014},"9":{"title":"Glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels and their relationships to clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study","year":2014}},"codelist_name":"asthma_clinicals","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/9/codelist/asthma_clinicals/download/","comments":{"comment_6":{"comment":"Asthma diagnosis is defined as a patient having at least one code from [asthma_clinicals] up to the end of the QOF year in question plus at least one code from [asthma_drugs] in the preceding year.
