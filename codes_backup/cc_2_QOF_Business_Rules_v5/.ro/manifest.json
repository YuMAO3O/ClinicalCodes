{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2","abstract":"This is the latest version of the Business Rulesets (September 2004), which have been updated to take account of the July Read Code Release.  Please note that this release introduces the use of SNOMED Clinical Terms. As it would not have been possible to fully include Read Codes Version 0, Read Codes Version 2, CTV3 and SNOMED-CT in a single document, the rulesets have been split into two sets. The first set contains only Read Codes Version 0. The second set includes Read Codes Version 2, CTV3 and SNOMED-CT. These documents will be further revised in line with the Read Code/SNOMED-CT release schedule. \r\n\r\n\r\nLink to original pdfs: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/2005 0103201524/http://www.dh.gov.uk:80/PolicyAndGuidance/OrganisationPolicy/PrimaryCare/ PrimaryCareContracting/PrimaryCareContractingArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4078648&chk=/FWc3u\r\n","article_ID":2,"article_title":"QOF Business Rules v5","article_type":"QOF Business Rules","authors":"Pete Horsfield","codelists":{"asthma":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Asthma","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/asthma/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":33,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"cancer":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Cancer","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/cancer/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":1227,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"chd":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"CHD","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/chd/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":115,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"copd":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"COPD","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/copd/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":44,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"diabetes":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Diabetes","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/diabetes/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":289,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"epilepsy":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Epilepsy","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/epilepsy/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":77,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"hypertension":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Hypertension","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/hypertension/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":24,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"hypothyroidism":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Hypothyroidism","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/hypothyroidism/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":36,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"lvd":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"LVD","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/lvd/download/","comments":{"comment_2":{"comment":"To qualify for inclusion a minimum of one code from each of the two groups is required.","submit_date":"2013-10-31 21:17:27","user_name":"David Springate"}},"num_codes":142,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"mentalillness":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"MentalIllness","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/mentalillness/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":3,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""},"stroke":{"associated_articles":{"2":{"title":"QOF Business Rules v5","year":2004}},"codelist_name":"Stroke","codelist_url":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/2/codelist/stroke/download/","comments":[],"num_codes":52,"user_field_1":"notes","user_field_2":"","user_field_3":""}},"comments":[],"correspondence_author":"NA","correspondence_email":"info@clinicalcodes.org","date_accessed":"2015-03-09 09:09:42 GMT","doi":"NA","fulltext":false,"journal":"NA","link":"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20050103201524/http://www.dh.gov.uk:80/PolicyAndGuidance/O","publication_year":2004,"uploading_user":"David Springate"}
