{"URI":"https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/7","abstract":"Objective \r\nTo conduct a fully independent and external validation of a research study based on one electronic health records database, using a different electronic database sampling the same population. \r\nDesign \r\nUsing the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we replicated a published investigation into the effects of statins in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) by a different research team using QResearch. We replicated the original methods and analysed all cause mortality using: (i) a cohort analysis and (ii) a case-control analysis nested within the full cohort. \r\nSetting \r\nElectronic health record databases containing longitudinal patient consultation data from large numbers of general practices distributed throughout the UK. \r\nParticipants \r\nCPRD data for 34925 patients with IHD from 224 general practices, compared against previously published results from QResearch for 13,029 patients from 89 general practices. The study period was January 1996 to December 2003. \r\nResults \r\nWe successfully replicated the methods of the original study very closely. In cohort analysis risk of death was lower by 55% for patients on statins, compared to 53% for QResearch (adjusted HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.50; versus 0.47, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.53). In case-control analyses patients on statins had a 31% lower odds of death, compared to 39% for QResearch (adjusted OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.75; versus OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72). Results were also close for individual statins. \r\nConclusion \r\nDatabase differences in population characteristics and in data definitions, recording, quality and completeness had minimal impact on key statistical outputs. The results uphold the validity of research using CPRD and QResearch, by providing independent evidence that both datasets produce very similar estimates of treatment effect, leading to the same clinical and policy decisions. Together with other, non-independent, replication studies there is a nascent body of evidence for wider validity.
